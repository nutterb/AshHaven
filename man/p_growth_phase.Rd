\usage{

  p_growth,
  g,
  fr,

\arguments{
\item{p_growth}{\code{numeric(1)} on the interval (0, 1). The probability of the
crop experiencing growth when it is assigned a random tick.}

\item{g}{\code{integerish}. Defaults to \code{0:max(f_r)}.}

\item{fr}{\code{integerish}. Defaults to \code{0:rts}.}

\item{f}{\code{integerish(1)}. The number of blocks of farmland.}

\item{random_tick_speed}{\code{integerish(1)}. the random tick speed (3 by default)}

\item{B}{\code{integerish(1)}. The number of blocks in a subchunk (16^3 by default)}
}
\description{
As a farm increases in size, the probability of a growth event
somewhere in the farm changes. The probability is dependent on the
number of blocks assigned to the farm. Furthermore, there may be anywhere
from zero to three blocks assigned a random tick, and anywhere from
zero to three of those randomly ticked blocks may experience growth.
The probability is a joint probability distribution of the hypergeometric
distribution (for the number of blocks receiving a random tick)
and a binomial distribution (for the number of randomly ticked blocks
that experience growth).
