#' @title Time to Crop Maturation
#' 
#' @description Time to Maturity (TTM) is the duration of time between when 
#'   it is planted and when it reaches a mature state and is ready to harvest. 
#'   Crops may encounter several stages of growth before maturityâ€“such as wheat, 
#'   which encounters eight growth stages.
#'   
#' @inheritParams TimeToGrowth
#' @param stages `integerish(1)`. The number of growth stages a crop requires
#' before becoming mature.
