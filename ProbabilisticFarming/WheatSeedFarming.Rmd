# Wheat Seed Farming

## Farm Metrics

Farm metrics for wheat seeds assume ideal growing conditions for wheat.

```{r}
stage = 8        # https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Wheat#Farming
yield = 2 + 5/7  # https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Wheat#Farming
pr_growth <- 1/3 # https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Tutorials/Crop_farming#Growth_rate
```

* Growth Stages: `r stage`
* $\Pr(Growth | RTick) = `r pr_growth`$
* Time to Growth (TTG)
    + $TTG_\mu = `r TTG_MEAN(pr_growth)`$
    + $TTG_M = `r TTG_MEDIAN(pr_growth)`$
    + $TTG_{0.05} = `r TTG_Q(0.05, pr_growth)`$
    + $TTG_{0.10} = `r TTG_Q(0.10, pr_growth)`$
    + $TTG_{0.90} = `r TTG_Q(0.90, pr_growth)`$
    + $TTG_{0.95} = `r TTG_Q(0.95, pr_growth)`$
* Time to Maturity (TTM) (8 stages)
    + $TTM_\mu = `r TTM_MEAN(pr_growth, stage = stage)`$
    + $TTM_M = `r TTM_MEDIAN(pr_growth, stage = stage)`$
    + $TTM_{0.05} = `r TTM_Q(0.05, pr_growth, stage = stage)`$
    + $TTM_{0.10} = `r TTM_Q(0.10, pr_growth, stage = stage)`$
    + $TTM_{0.90} = `r TTM_Q(0.90, pr_growth, stage = stage)`$
    + $TTM_{0.95} = `r TTM_Q(0.95, pr_growth, stage = stage)`$
* Expected Crop Output (ECO)
    + $ECO_\mu = `r ECO_MEAN(yield, pr_growth, stage)`$
    + $ECO_M = `r ECO_MEDIAN(yield, pr_growth, stage)`$
* Net Smelting Gain (NSG)
    + N/A
* Perpetual Furnace Index (PFI)
    + N/A
