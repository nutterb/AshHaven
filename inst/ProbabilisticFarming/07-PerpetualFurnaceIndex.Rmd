# Perpetual Furnace Index

The Perpetual Furnace Index (PFI) is the number blocks of farm that are required to maintain continuous and uninterupted operation of a single furnace in a self sufficient manner. Furnaces smelt six items per minute, so this is the number of blocks of farm required to provide enough fuel to smelt six items per minute. The PFI must also account for raw materials required to convert itself into fuel. 

$$\begin{aligned}
& &                     6 &= \frac{PFI}{CC} \cdot ECO \cdot NSG \\ 
&\Rightarrow & \frac{6 \cdot CC}{ECO \cdot NSG} &= PFI 
\end{aligned}$$

Where

* $CC$ is the number of items consumed in crafting the fuel
* $ECO$ is the Expected Crop Output
* $NSG$ is the Net Smelting Gain

## Mean Perpetual Furnace Index 

$$PFI_\mu = \frac{6 \cdot CC}{ECO_\mu \cdot NSG}$$

## Median Perpetual Furnace Index 

$$PFI_M = \frac{6 \cdot CC}{ECO_M \cdot NSG}$$

## Quantiles of Perpetual Furnace Index 

$$PFI_p = \frac{6 \cdot CC}{ECO_p \cdot NSG}$$
